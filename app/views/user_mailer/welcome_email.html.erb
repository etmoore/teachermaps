      Thank you for being a part of our Alpha testing. We've had a fun
      time working on this project and we're excited to finally be able
      to share it with you. With your help, we can make TeacherMaps
      a tool that will help improve the lives of educators everywhere.

    <h1>How you can help</h1>
    <p>
      The best thing you can do to help this product along is to use it.
      Even if you're not a teacher, you may be able to use TeacherMaps
      to bookmark your favorite websites, organize some Dropbox files,
      or even your own coursework. If you come up with a creative
      use of the product, we'd love to hear it! Check in when you can,
      we'll be making changes every week. If you need help getting started,
      check out our <%= link_to "help documentation", controller: 'static_pages', action: 'help', only_path: false, host: @host %>.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this alpha period we expect to find a range of issues,
      from usability to instability and unavailability. Any time you
      experience an issue, let us know either by using the
      feedback tool at the top of every page when you're logged in
      or by sending us a mail at
      <a href="mailto:support@teachermaps.com">support@teachermaps.com</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      With your help, the first TeacherMaps public customers
      won't suffer through any of the issues we may subject you to.
      We apoligize in advance :)
    </p>
    <p>Thanks for your help and support!</p>
