How you can help

The best thing you can do to help this product along is to use it
and give us feedback. Even if you're not a teacher, consider using
TeacherMaps to bookmark your favorite websites or sort your
Dropbox and Google Drive files. If you come up with a creative
use of the product, we'd love to hear it! Check in when you can,
we'll be making improvements every week. If you need help getting
started, check out our
<%= url_for controller: 'static_pages', action: 'help', only_path: false, host: @host %>

During this alpha period we expect to find a range of issues,
from usability to instability and unavailability. Any time you
experience an issue, let us know either by using the feedback
tool at the top of every page when you're logged in or by sending
us a mail at
support@teachermaps.com

With your help, we can ensure that later TeacherMaps customers
wonâ€™t have to suffer through any of the issues we may subject you
to. We apologize in advance :)

Thanks for your help and support!
