How you can help

The best thing you can do to help this product along is to use it.
Even if you're not a teacher, you may be able to use TeacherMaps
to bookmark your favorite websites, organize some Dropbox files,
or even your own coursework. If you come up with a creative
use of the product, we'd love to hear it! Check in when you can,
we'll be making changes every week. If you need help getting started,
check out our help documentation:
<%= url_for controller: 'static_pages', action: 'help', only_path: false, host: @host %>

During this alpha period we expect to find a range of issues,
from usability to instability and unavailability. Any time you
experience an issue, let us know either by using the
feedback tool at the top of every page when you're logged in
or by sending us a mail at:
support@teachermaps.com

With your help, the first TeacherMaps public customers
won't suffer through any of the issues we may subject you to.
We apoligize in advance :)

Thanks for your help and support!

Evan, James, and Drew
