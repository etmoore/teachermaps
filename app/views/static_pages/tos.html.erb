<h1>TeacherMaps Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last modified: May 6, 2013</p>

<h3>Welcome to TeacherMaps!</h3>

<p>
  Thanks for using our products and services (“Services”). The Services
  are provided by TeacherMaps Inc. (“TeacherMaps”), located at
  3020 Mountain Lion Drive #204, Loveland, CO 80537, United States.
  </p>

<p>
  By using our Services, you are agreeing to these terms. Please read them carefully.
</p>

<p>
  Our Services are very diverse, so sometimes additional terms or
  product requirements (including age requirements) may apply.
  Additional terms will be available with the relevant Services, and
  those additional terms become part of your agreement with us if you
  use those Services.
</p>

<h3>Using our Services</h3>

<p>
  You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services.
</p>

<p>
  Don’t misuse our Services. For example, don’t interfere with our
  Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface
  and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only
  as permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export
  control laws and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our
  Services to you if you do not comply with our terms or policies or
  if we are investigating suspected misconduct.
</p>

<p>
  Using our Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual
  property rights in our Services or the content you access. You may
  not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission from
  its owner or are otherwise permitted by law. These terms do not
  grant you the right to use any branding or logos used in our
  Services. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any legal notices displayed
  in or along with our Services.
</p>

<p>
  Our Services display some content that is not TeacherMaps’s. This
  content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it
  available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal
  or violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display
  content that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law.
  But that does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please
  don’t assume that we do.
</p>

<p>
  In connection with your use of the Services, we may send you service
  announcements, administrative messages, and other information. You may
  opt out of some of those communications.
</p>

<h3>Your TeacherMaps Account</h3>

<p>
  You may need a TeacherMaps Account in order to use some of our
  Services. You may create your own TeacherMaps Account, or your
  TeacherMaps Account may be assigned to you by an administrator, such
  as your employer or educational institution. If you are using a
  TeacherMaps Account assigned to you by an administrator, different or
  additional terms may apply and your administrator may be able to
  access or disable your account.
</p>

</p>

<h3>Privacy and Copyright Protection</h3>

<p>
  TeacherMaps’s
  <%= link_to 'privacy policy', controller: 'static_pages', action: 'privacy' %>
  explain how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when
  you use our Services. By using our Services, you agree that TeacherMaps
  can use such data in accordance with our privacy policies.
</p>

<p>
  We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement and terminate
  accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the
  U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
</p>

<p>
  We provide information to help copyright holders manage their
  intellectual property online. If you think somebody is violating your
  copyrights and want to notify us, please
  <%= link_to 'contact us', controller: 'static_pages', action: 'contact' %>.
</p>

<h3>Your Content in our Services</h3>

<p>
  Some of our Services allow you to submit content. You retain
  ownership of any intellectual property rights that you hold in that
  content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours.
</p>

<p>
  When you upload or otherwise submit content to our Services, you give
  TeacherMaps (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use,
  host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works (such as
  those resulting from translations, adaptations or other changes we
  make so that your content works better with our Services),
  communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and
  distribute such content. The rights you grant in this license are for
  the limited purpose of operating, promoting, and improving our
  Services, and to develop new ones. This license continues even if you
  stop using our Services (for example, for a map you have added to
  TeacherMaps). Some Services may offer you ways to access
  and remove content that has been provided to that Service. Also, in
  some of our Services, there are terms or settings that narrow the
  scope of our use of the content submitted in those Services. Make
  sure you have the necessary rights to grant us this license for any
  content that you submit to our Services.
</p>

<p>
  You can find more information about how TeacherMaps uses and stores
  content in the
  <%= link_to 'privacy policy', controller: 'static_pages', action: 'privacy' %>.
  If you submit feedback or suggestions about our Services, we may use
  your feedback or suggestions without obligation to you.
</p>

<h3>About Software in our Services</h3>

<p>
  When a Service requires or includes downloadable software, this
  software may update automatically on your device once a new version
  or feature is available. Some Services may let you adjust your
  automatic update settings.
</p>

<p>
  TeacherMaps gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free,
  non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software
  provided to you by TeacherMaps as part of the Services. This
  license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy
  the benefit of the Services as provided by TeacherMaps, in the manner
  permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell,
  or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you
  reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that
  software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our
  written permission.
</p>

<p>
  Open source software is important to us. Some software used in our
  Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make
  available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license
  that expressly override some of these terms.
</p>

<h3>Modifying and Terminating our Services</h3>

<p>
  We are constantly changing and improving our Services. We may add or
  remove functionalities or features, and we may suspend or stop a Service altogether.
</p>

<p>
  You can stop using our Services at any time, although we’ll be sorry
  to see you go. TeacherMaps may also stop providing Services to you,
  or add or create new limits to our Services at any time.
</p>

<p>
  We believe that you own your data and preserving your access to such
  data is important. If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably
  possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to
  get information out of that Service.
</p>

<h3>Our Warranties and Disclaimers</h3>

<p>
  We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of
  skill and care and we hope that you will enjoy using them. But there
  are certain things that we don’t promise about our Services.
</p>

<p>
  OTHER THAN AS EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS,
  NEITHER TEACHERMAPS NOR ITS SUPPLIERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY
  SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON’T MAKE ANY
  COMMITMENTS ABOUT THE CONTENT WITHIN THE SERVICES, THE SPECIFIC
  FUNCTION OF THE SERVICES, OR THEIR RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, OR
  ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS. WE PROVIDE THE SERVICES “AS IS”.
</p>

<p>
  SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED
  WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
  NON-INFRINGEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES.
</p>

<h3>Liability for our Services</h3>

<p>
  WHEN PERMITTED BY LAW, TEACHERMAPS, AND TEACHERMAPS’S SUPPLIERS AND
  DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR
  DATA, FINANCIAL LOSSES OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY,
  OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.
</p>

<p>
  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF TEACHERMAPS,
  AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, FOR ANY CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS,
  INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU
  PAID US TO USE THE SERVICES (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE
  SERVICES AGAIN).
</p>

<p>
  IN ALL CASES, TEACHERMAPS, AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL
  NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.
</p>

<h3>Business uses of our Services</h3>

<p>
  If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business
  accepts these terms. It will hold harmless and indemnify TeacherMaps
  and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees from any claim,
  suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or
  violation of these terms, including any liability or expense arising
  from claims, losses, damages, suits, judgments, litigation costs and attorneys’ fees.
</p>

<h3>About these Terms</h3>

<p>
  We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a
  Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our
  Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We’ll post notice of
  modifications to these terms on this page. Changes will not apply
  retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days
  after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for
  a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective
  immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service,
  you should discontinue your use of that Service.
</p>

<p>
  If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms,
  the additional terms will control for that conflict.
</p>

<p>
  These terms control the relationship between TeacherMaps and you.
  They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.
</p>

<p>
  If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action
  right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights that
  we may have (such as taking action in the future).
</p>

<p>
  If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will
  not affect any other terms.
</p>

<p>
  The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of
  laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to
  these terms or the Services. All claims arising out of or relating to
  these terms or the Services will be litigated exclusively in the
  federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and
  you and TeacherMaps consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
